# I-ReaxFF: stand for Intelligent-Reactive Force Field

ffield: the parameter file from machine learning
reax.lib  the parameter file converted from ffield for usage with GULP

*.gen file is final MD result from siesta or ReaxFF-(GULP), and can be visilized by ASE(command ase gui *.gen)

HBondCage.gif shows a molecular dynamics simulations results with ReaxFF (paramters from machine learning) at temperature of 50 K.
